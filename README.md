# Class 11

This repository contains the starter code for class 11 and the
subsequent homework.

It is up to you whether you want to use `struct vector` or do the work
using native C arrays. In the former case, you can add your averaging
and integration examples in `linear_algebra`, otherwise, you can
create a new directory and work there.
